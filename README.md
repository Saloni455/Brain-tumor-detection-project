## Overview
This project is an end-to-end deep learning solution for automated brain tumor detection and classification from MRI images. It leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. The project includes model training, evaluation, visualization, and a professional presentation for stakeholders.
## Features
- Multi-class brain tumor classification (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor)
- Custom CNN architecture with batch normalization, dropout, and regularization
- Data augmentation and preprocessing for robust training
- Detailed performance metrics and visualizations
